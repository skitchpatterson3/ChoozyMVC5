# ChoozyMVC5
Choozy is an MVC 5 Razor app built in .NET using C#. Site functionality is powered by jQuery with Bootstrap styling.

This app allows you to add people to a list and with the click of a button, return a name at random to help you pick who does what during the events of the day.

Choozy was specifically designed to quickly make assignments for recurring informal events like:
<ul>
  <li>Family prayer</li>
  <li>Family Home Evening (FHE)</li>
  <li>Home chores</li>
</ul>

Choozy may later be expanded to support organizing a calendar of home meals to make meal planning easy as pie (with the option to include "pie" as a dinner plan, <em> wink wink</em>).
